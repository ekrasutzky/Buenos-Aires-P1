        <h2>What to do in Buenos Aires</h2>

            <h3>• Colon Theatre •</h3>
            <div id="colon"></div>
            <p>One of the buildings that will trigger your interest will be Teatro Colon. It’s located near the
                Obelisco. Teatro Colon is an opera house that opened in 1908 and rumored as one of the best opera houses
                in the world. The acoustic is magnificent they say. I went a couple of times to watch the Philharmonic
                orchestra of Buenos Aires. Truly, a wonderful experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>• MALBA Museum •</h3>
            <div id="malba"></div>
            <p>Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires (MALBA)
                If you have to pick one museum to see in Buenos Aires, MALBA should be your pick. The modern building,
                surrounded by the Palermo parks and ambassadors' mansions, is known for its permanent collection of
                famed contemporary Latin American artists, with works by Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Fernando Botero,
                Antonio Berni and Tarsila do Amaral in its arsenal. Its dynamic team of curators has also put together
                some of the most interesting temporary exhibits in the city too; one season, they may highlight
                Argentine or Latin American art, and another, International, modern, or Contemporary. Ninina Bakery, a
                top coffee and pastry café, recently took over the restaurant space to bring quality eats to the
                museum—so don't miss a refueling pitstop there.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>• Nacional Museum of Fine Arts (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes) •</h3>
            <div id="nacional"></div>
            <p>This is the most well-known museum in all of Argentina—and for good reason. Located in the upscale
                Recoleta neighborhood, the fine arts museum is home to a staggering collection of 19th-century European
                art, holdings that include over 700 major works by artists like Goya, Van Gogh, and Toulouse Lautrec.
                There’s a lot to see, so it makes sense to tackle the museum strategically, and with a guide. Artist
                Germán Warszatska leads free English tours on Tuesday, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 1 p.m.; though if you
                decide to skip the tour, head straight for the 19th-century European art wing on the first floor, widely
                considered the most important collection in South America.</p>

            <h3>• El Ateneo Bookstore •</h3>
            <div id="ateneo"></div>
            <p>Did you know that Buenos Aires has the highest bookstores per capita? El Ateneo Bookstore wasn’t always a
                bookstore. Before there was a marvelous theater with 1.050 seats in the eclectic-styled building. In the
                ’20s the theater was rebuilt into a cinema and in 1929 the first movies with sounds were played here.
                The Guardian placed El Ateneo in second place for the most beautiful bookstores in the world. Worth a
                visit and put it on your list of things to do in Buenos Aires.</p>

            <h3>• El viejo Almacen- Tango •</h3>
            <div id="tango"></div>
            <p>El Viejo Almacen tango has over 50 years of experience in bringing tango on a high level. The tango was
                performed by 4 tango couples, a live band, and a singer. The dinner takes place in El Viejo Almacens
                restaurant across the street and afterward you are guided to the tango hall. The performances were great
                and the music was good to hear in the hall. And of course, the food was delicious. Great quality when I
                went. The room is cozy with small round tables with candles on it. Also, there is a balcony that gives
                you a view from above.

                El Viejo Almacen is located in the oldest neighborhood of Buenos Aires, San Telmo. Easy to reach by taxi
                or public transport.</p>
