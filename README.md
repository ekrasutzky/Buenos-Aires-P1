# Buenos Aires

This project is about to try to show a bit of Buenos Aires City (city where i was born). This came up because after living four years abroad, i was a bit homesick and i got this idea.

I thought about this website as a good option to try to show future tourists a little bit of where to start discovering this amazing city. 
Users of Buenos Aires website, will find four basics cathegories : Food, Culture , City and Newsletter. In these categories they'll finde options to enjoy some good food, entertainment options, places to visit and of course, a newsletter section where they can suscribe to ask anything and/or get more suggestions of what to do in this city. 

Buenos Aires is a website that encourages future visitors to have a little idea of where to start their trip. It aims to cover the basics to enjoy this great city.
