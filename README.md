# Buenos Aires

This project is about to try to show a bit of Buenos Aires City (city where i was born). This came up because after living four years abroad, i was a bit homesick and i got this idea.

I thought about this website as a good option to try to show future tourists a little bit of where to start discovering this amazing city. 
Users of Buenos Aires website, will find four basics cathegories : Food, Culture , City and Newsletter. In these categories they'll finde options to enjoy some good food, entertainment options, places to visit and of course, a newsletter section where they can suscribe to ask anything and/or get more suggestions of what to do in this city. 

Buenos Aires is a website that encourages future visitors to have a little idea of where to start their trip. It aims to cover the basics to enjoy this great city.

## ♥ First View of the site

- First thing the user will see, is the logo and the nav bar and after that, a big image with a cover text displayed . 

- This image and all around it was decided to be like that in order to catch users' eye and produce an impact on them with all the colors from the image and a welcoming text. 

        ♥ The color scheme has been chosen and applied through the whole website on purpose, since blue, white and yellow are Argentina's flag colors.
