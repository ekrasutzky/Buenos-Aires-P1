<h3>Puerto Madero</h3>
<p>Take a stroll in Puerto Madero.
Situated along the water, this modern cosmopolitan neighborhood is worth a stroll.
Be sure to traverse the iconic and sleek Puente de la Mujer (“Bridge of the Woman”) and take note that all of the streets in this barrio are named after women.
Or you can head to the Reserva Ecológica if you want to catch a glimpse of the Atlantic Ocean.
Here, you’ll be able to wander footpaths or ride the bike trails of the park to see a bit of wildlife on this greener edge of the city.
</p>

<h3>Palermo</h3>
<p>
    Palermo is a cultural neighborhood by itself. Here you can take a look to Plaza Serrano's fair each weekend , have drinks, go clubbing and have a real authentic argentinean food.
    Up-and-coming Argentine designers ply their wares at the Feria de Plaza Serrano and the Feria Artesanal de Palermo Viejo.
    You can snag goods like one-of-a-kind jewelry, discounted clothing, and quirky accessories from their stalls.
    Make sure to check out the independent vendors that sell their stuff at pop-up shops in the stores around Plaza Serrano (and any other free outdoor spaces and open areas they can find). Browse the hip and trendy shops for cheap ensembles before you head for a beer or pre-dinner snack at one the many nearby bars.
    Speaking of, Plaza Serrano is a favorite locale in the ever-popular Palermo Soho for an outdoor drink – tons of cafes and bars have tables and chairs that spill out onto the street every evening.
    Grab a liter of cold Quilmes and watch the sun set on one of the city’s coolest neighborhoods.
    If you’re in the mood for craft beers or international finds, just walk a little ways from the plaza and you’ll find The Temple Bar and Antares with more diverse selections.

<h3>Corrientes Av.</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Obelisco</h3>
<p>
Situated in the intersection of the biggest main avenues of the city, 9 de Julio Av. and Corrientes Av. , there's one of the most famous landmarks of Buenos Aires City. Probably one of the first pictures that comes to your mind when you think you can think about Buenos Aires. A friendly reminding: It gets full of tourists, so keep an eye on your belonging when you get there. </p>


<h3>Recoleta's Cementery</h3>
<p>This is no ordinary cemetery. It’s a place of rest for the rich, famous, and powerful of Argentina.

    You’ll find impressive, ornate mausoleums packed tightly in this little corner of the city where you can wander for hours amidst a maze of the family graves.
    Admission is free, but you may need to purchase a map to find your way around.
    Perhaps the most “popular” site here is first lady Eva Perón’s tomb, where people still leave flowers and tributes.
    After paying your respects to Evita, snapping some haunting photos, and petting a few stray cats, have a peek inside the Basilica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar next door.

<h3>San Telmo Market</h3>
<p>
This colorful, crowded Sunday street fair – the Feria de San Telmo – draws over 12,000 people each week.
There’s tons of antiques, artwork, knick knacks, and other treasures laid out along the pedestrian street of Defensa.
It’s the perfect place to get an original souvenir that dates back to the golden age of Buenos Aires.
Keep an eye on your belongings as you wander the 270 stalls of this local bazaar, purchase some homemade snacks, and watch the street performers do their thing along the 13 cobblestone blocks.
